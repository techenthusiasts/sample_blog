It was a challenge to change the Jekyll theme from the default Minima to the theme from https://github.com/mmistakes/jekyll-theme-basically-basic

I followed the instructions from the README.md file of the creators repository, but I encourage error when I try to run 'bundle exec jekyll serve' from my Windows 10 machine.
